I am a data professional who builds intuitive data products for business users with sustainable back-ends for technical users. As an enterprise data generalist, I consult for various teams, including sales, strategy, marketing, finance, compliance, legal, and customer care.

I build data teams to rapidly develop MVPs and POCs for business units and develop long-term data communities to solve persistant and complex enterprise data problems.

Please feel free to explore my portfolio, review my CV, and contact me if you are interested in working together.
