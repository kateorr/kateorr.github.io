# Explore My Work

I am a data professional who builds intuitive data products for business users with sustainable back-ends for technical users. A data generalist, I have worked as an enterprise data consultant for teams across an organization, including sales, strategy, marketing, finance, compliance, legal, and customer care.

I build data teams to quickly develop MVPs and POCs for business units, and invest long-term in developing data analytics communities to share solutions to an organizations most persistant and complex data problems.
