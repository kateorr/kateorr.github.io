I specialize in building sustainable data products for organizational use. My experience collaborating with Sales, Digital, Marketing, Finance, Legal and Compliance, Product, and Customer Service teams has made me a versatile data generalist. I create intuitive dashboards and visualizations using tools like Tableau and Power BI for everyone from executives to junior analysts to front-end users.

On the back-end, I am dedicated to developing sustainable data processes. I have implemented version control standards using Git, Agile methodology, and data documentation patterns. Additionally, I have created a suite of stakeholder-facing documentation templates, including statements of work, impact measurement plans, and weekly updates. I also focus on upskilling other analysts to maintain and enhance my work, ensuring high standards of craftsmanship across various data stewards and users.

I have successfully transitioned to sustainable data models by leveraging cloud infrastructure, including Snowflake and AWS. This transition has enabled scalable, efficient, and secure data management, supporting advanced analytics and real-time data processing.

When Iâ€™m not in the office, you can find me rock climbing around Southern California, cooking fruit tarts, and playing Scythe or Seven Wonders.
